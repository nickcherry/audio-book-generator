# Audio Book Generator

Before you can run `txt2mp3`, you'll need to give it executable permissions:

```shell
sudo chmod 700 txt2mp3.sh
```

To convert a `.txt` file to audio form, run `txt2mp3` and provide the text file as the one and only argument, e.g.

```shell
./txt2mp3.sh 'on-aggression/chapter-08.txt'
```

The `.mp3` file will be created in the same directory as the text file.
